  I am a final year Master's student at IIT Delhi, studying Mathematics and Computing. I was also a visiting Research Assistant at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada in SFU NatLang Lab for the Spring and Summer 2023 terms.
  I was also a visiting intern in the 3DLG lab at SFU. I am interested in Multimodal NLP and Translation.

          _Simultaneous Machine Translation (Published in IWSLT Workshop @ ACL 2023)_
          SiMT models struggle to maintain translation quality while keeping latency low. In my work, we used an auxiliary language model to augment the training of the decoder model. Under this notion of target adaptive training, generating rare or difficult tokens is rewarded which improves the translation quality while reducing latency. The predictions made by a language model in the decoder are combined with the traditional cross entropy loss which frees up the focus on the source side context

          Explored text augmentations such as word-dropout and switch-out for the TriCoLo model and used these to train the encoder with SimCSE method. Compared improvements in sentence embeddings by using pretrained models like BERT, GLoVe, and SentenceBERT.

        description: |
          Replaced traditional hash functions with a random projection-based approach to exploit patterns in the data. Found upper bounds for size and false positive rate for the proposed method with extensive mathematical grounding. Awarded the Undergraduate Research Award for the project and laid the groundwork for a VLDB publication.

          Established in 1636, Harvard is the oldest higher education institution in the United States, and is widely regarded in terms of its influence, reputation, and academic pedigree as a leading university in not just the US but also the world.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the university and learned a lot about a healthy work-life balance.
          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.

      Alongside my interests in NLP and maths, some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Reading (mostly fiction, you can check out my latest reads on my Goodreads)
      - Hiking (I like taking nature pictures!)
      - Anime
