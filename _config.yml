  Hi, I am a final year Master's student at IIT Delhi, studying Mathematics and Computing. I was also a visiting Research Assistant at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada in SFU NatLang Lab for the Spring and Summer 2023 terms. 
  I was also a visiting intern in the 3DLG lab at SFU. I am interested in Multimodal NLP and Translation.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          Simultaneous Machine Translation
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I improved Meta’s Monotonic Multihead Attention (MMA) model with target-adaptive training using an auxiliary language model in the decoder for the aim of rewarding generation of rare or difficult tokens. My method achieved significant gains in BLEU (translation quality) and Latency (translation delay) scores over various other SoTA models in English-German and English-Vietnamese translations of the IWSLT Dataset. |
          I also introduced structured multi-head attention to MMA to predict the “window” of cross-attention using target token information to extend the rigid infinite-lookback and hard setting of MMA.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.

      Alongside my interests in NLP and maths, some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Reading (mostly fiction, you can check out my latest reads on my goodreads)
      - Hiking (I like taking nature pictures!)
      - Anime
