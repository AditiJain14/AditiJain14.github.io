  Hi, I am a final year Master's student at IIT Delhi, studying Mathematics and Computing. I was also a visiting Research Assistant at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada in SFU NatLang Lab for the Spring and Summer 2023 terms. 
  I was also a visiting intern in the 3DLG lab at SFU. I am interested in Multimodal NLP and Translation.

          SiMT models struggle to maintain translation quality while keeping latency low. In my work, we used an auxiliary language model to augment the training of the decoder model. Under this notion of target adaptive training, generating rare or difficult tokens is rewarded which improves the translation quality while reducing latency. The predictions made by a language model in the decoder are combined with the traditional cross entropy loss which frees up the focus on the source side context

            Explored text augmentations such as word-dropout and switch-out for the TriCoLo model and used these to train the encoder with SimCSE method. Compared improvements in sentence embeddings by using pretrained models like BERT, GLoVe, and SentenceBERT.

            Replaced traditional hash functions with a random projection-based approach to exploit patterns in the data. Found upper bounds for size and false positive rate for the proposed method with extensive mathematical grounding. Awarded the Undergraduate Research Award for the project and laid the groundwork for a VLDB publication.

            Prepared a new VQA dataset with 3 categorical rephrasings (30k questions) Logical Equivalence, Necessary Condition and Mutual Exclusion - made from the VQA validation dataset which contributed to an ICPRW paper. Trained character-level & word-level encoder decoder models for rephrasing generation based on RNNs and also experimented with a pretrained DistilBert model and added a Gensim embedding layer to improve rephrasing generation.

  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

        During my undergrad, I studied introductory and advanced level courses of probability and statistics, linear algebra, calculus, game theory, optimization, data mining and data structures and algorithms.  I also took 2 electives of linguistics studying structure and function of word in language. 
        I was also an active member of the Literary Society at IIT Delhi.

      Alongside my interests in NLP and maths, some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Reading (mostly fiction, you can check out my latest reads on my goodreads)
      - Hiking (I like taking nature pictures!)
      - Obsessing over cats
